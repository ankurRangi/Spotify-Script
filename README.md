# Spotify-Script
A Python script for automatically muting the Ads for nonpremium users and unmuting when songs play using the chrome driver.

## Please use the latest version of Chrome driver.

Have fun

Few Feature: 
It lets you know the number the ads paused the whole time you used the script.

It does not violate any rules of Spotify, I am not making a cracked version or anything else.

I made it during lockdown and was very happy to see it work, as I hoped it would.
